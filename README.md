# Smart-Receipt-AI
a web application that helps users organize shopping receipts and understand their spending without manually entering information.

## User Problem
Users currently have to manually enter receipt details (store, date, items,
prices, tax, total) after every purchase, which is time-consuming and
error-prone.

## MVP
A user can upload one shopping receipt (image or PDF), the system uses AI
to extract the important purchase information, and displays the result
clearly for review.
